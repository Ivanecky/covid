# Welcome to COVIZ
## What is COVIZ?
COVIZ utilizes the data provided by the New York Times to display data around the coronavirus situation in the United States. Occasionally, the NYT will upload days with skewed results based on mishandling of data on the state level. If you see a dramatic drop in cases (close to 0), it is likely due to a misreport and not a day of no new cases in a state.
## Where does the data come from?
Data on the coronavirus cases comes from the New York Times. Population data was taken from the US Census as of 2019 (most recent).
## What makes up the app?
The Shiny application has a number of pages, including:
* State: This is where you can get specific information for any state. Just type the state name and hit "Update Data".
* United States: This is country level data.
* Tracking Changes: This is a page for tracking changes in data over a two-week period. It compares the data from a state today versus two weeks ago to help identify trends.
